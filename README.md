# Interpreting Object-level Foundation Models via Visual Precision Search

## üì∞ News & Update

- **[2024.09.30]** We begin to investigate the potential of interpretability in object detection.

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment

For our interpretation method, the packages we use are relatively common. Please mainly install `pytorch`, etc.

We provide code to explain Grounding DINO, but please install its dependencies first: [https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO).

For explaining Florence-2, please install its dependencies: [https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Florence-2-large-ft](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Florence-2-large-ft)

For explaining traditional detectors, please install MMDetection v3.3: [https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection)

In addition, please follow the [datasets/readme.md](datasets/readme.md) and [ckpt/readme.md](ckpt/readme.md) to organize the dataset and download the weights of the relevant detectors.

## üòÆ Highlights

We provide some results of our approach on interpreting object detection models.
